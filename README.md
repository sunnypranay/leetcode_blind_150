# LeetCode Blind 150 Solutions

Welcome to the LeetCode Blind 150 solutions repository! This is a collection of my personal solutions to the handpicked list of 150 problems essential for nailing coding interviews. These problems are sourced from the well-renowned LeetCode platform and part of the "Blind 150" list.

Each problem's solution is encapsulated within a separate branch of this repository. Here's how to navigate to them:

1. Click on the `Branch: main` button located at the top of the repository's file list.
2. From the dropdown, select the branch corresponding to the problem you're interested in. Each branch is dedicated to a distinct problem's solution.
3. On selecting the branch, you'll be led to the problem description, my Python solution, along with a thorough explanation of my approach and the solution's time and space complexity.

Though solutions are provided predominantly in Python, I strongly encourage contributors to submit solutions in other programming languages. It'd be great to have a variety of solutions in different languages.

Feel free to browse through the solutions, ask any questions, contribute, or provide feedback. Your interaction makes this repository a dynamic space for learning and growth!

Happy coding!
