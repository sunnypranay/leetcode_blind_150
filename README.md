## Intuition

Given a list of numbers that are in ascending order and a target value, our objective is to find two numbers such that they add up to the target value. One of the quickest ways to do this on a sorted list is to employ a two-pointer technique. Starting with one pointer at the beginning (the smallest value) and one at the end (the largest value), we can adjust our pointers to converge onto a solution. If the current sum is too small, we can move the left pointer to the right (increasing the value), and if the sum is too large, we can move the right pointer to the left (decreasing the value). 

## Approach

1. Initialize two pointers: `left_pointer` at the beginning and `right_pointer` at the end of the list.
2. Calculate the sum of the values at the `left_pointer` and `right_pointer`.
3. Compare this sum with the target:
   - If it's equal to the target, we've found our solution and can return the indices.
   - If it's greater than the target, decrement the `right_pointer` to try a smaller number.
   - If it's smaller than the target, increment the `left_pointer` to try a larger number.
4. Repeat this process until we either find the two numbers or the pointers cross, indicating no solution exists in the list.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**: \( O(n) \). In the worst case, we will move one of the pointers across all elements once.
  
- **Space complexity**: \( O(1) \). We only use a constant amount of extra space for our pointers and other variables, regardless of the input size.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left_pointer = 0
        right_pointer = len(numbers) - 1

        while True:
            if numbers[left_pointer] + numbers[right_pointer] == target:
                return [left_pointer + 1, right_pointer + 1]
            
            if numbers[left_pointer] + numbers[right_pointer] > target:
                right_pointer -= 1
            
            elif numbers[left_pointer] + numbers[right_pointer] < target:
                left_pointer += 1
```
