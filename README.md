# Intuition
The problem is to check if any permutation of `s1` is a substring of `s2`. We can solve this by using the sliding window technique. The window should be of the same size as `s1` and should slide over `s2`.

# Approach
1. If the length of `s1` is greater than `s2`, return False.
2. Create frequency arrays for `s1` and the first `len(s1)` characters of `s2`.
3. Track how many characters match perfectly between the two arrays (`matches` variable).
4. Slide the window over `s2`. At each step:
    - Check the incoming character of the window in `s2`, adjust its frequency and the `matches` count.
    - Check the outgoing character of the window in `s2`, adjust its frequency and the `matches` count.
    - If all 26 characters match perfectly (i.e., `matches == 26`), it means a permutation of `s1` is present in `s2`, return True.
5. If you've checked all windows and haven't returned True, return False.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$ where `n` is the length of `s2`. Each character in `s2` is processed once.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$ because the space used by the frequency arrays is constant (26 characters).

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if len(s1) > len(s2): return False

        s1Count, s2Count = [0] * 26, [0] * 26

        matches = 0

        for i in range(len(s1)):
            s1Count[ord(s1[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
            s2Count[ord(s2[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        for i in range(len(s1Count)):
            if s1Count[i] == s2Count[i]:
                matches += 1
        
        left = 0
        
        for right in range(len(s1), len(s2)):
            if matches == 26: return True
            index = ord(s2[right]) - ord("a")

            s2Count[index] += 1

            if s2Count[index] == s1Count[index]:
                matches += 1
            
            elif s2Count[index] == s1Count[index] + 1:
                matches -= 1
            
            index = ord(s2[left]) - ord("a")

            s2Count[index] -= 1

            if s2Count[index] == s1Count[index]:
                matches += 1
            
            elif s2Count[index] == s1Count[index] - 1:
                matches -= 1
            
            left += 1
        
        return matches == 26
